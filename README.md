Tubecast is a web app that is meant to recreate the classic Comcast TV Guide Channel and OnDemand Screen experience.  The user lands on the TV Guide screen to see an autoscrolling list of channels.

Each program block in the channel reflects a video hosted on YouTube.  If the user clicks on the program block, the video associated is loaded into the on-screen video player.

Each channel block is a link to the that channel's OnDemand screen.  When clicked the user can peruse all the programs scheduled on the channel at there leisure.
